-=- Projectiles Be Gone -=-

Sick of projectiles constantly cluttering up your screen? Can't make out hostile projectiles because you and your friends are using insanely over the top weapons?
This mod allows you to show only the projectiles that matter to you.

Through the /projMode command you are able to pick between 4 visibility settings: showing all projectiles, hostile and your projectiles, just hostile projectiles, or no projectiles at all.
The /hideDust command allows you to also completely remove any dust that is created from your weapons to allow for a completely clutter free experience.
